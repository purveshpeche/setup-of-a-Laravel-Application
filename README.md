# Distributed Laravel Application Setup

This document outlines the architecture and setup instructions for hosting a Laravel application in a distributed, secure, scalable, and cost-effective manner. The system comprises a Web Server, PHP-FPM, Redis, MySQL, and Elasticsearch, orchestrated using Docker and deployed on AWS.

## Architecture Overview

The application is deployed on AWS using a combination of services to ensure scalability, security, and cost efficiency:

- **Web Server**: Nginx, hosted in Docker containers, serves as the entry point, handling HTTP requests and static assets.
- **PHP-FPM**: Processes PHP requests, running in Docker containers, scaled horizontally via AWS ECS.
- **Redis**: Used for caching and session management, deployed as a managed AWS ElastiCache cluster.
- **MySQL**: Stores relational data, deployed as a managed AWS RDS instance with read replicas for scalability.
- **Elasticsearch**: Handles search and analytics, deployed as a managed AWS OpenSearch Service cluster.
- **Load Balancer**: AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) distributes traffic across Nginx containers.
- **Container Orchestration**: AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) with Fargate for serverless container management.
- **Networking**: AWS VPC with private and public subnets, security groups, and NAT gateways for secure communication.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated builds and deployments.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: AWS CloudWatch for metrics and logs, with alerts for performance issues.

## Prerequisites

- AWS Account with configured CLI and IAM roles
- Docker and Docker Compose installed locally for development
- Laravel application codebase
- GitHub repository for CI/CD
- Domain name (optional, for custom DNS)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Infrastructure Setup (AWS)

1. **VPC Configuration**:

   - Create a VPC with public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones (AZs).
   - Public subnets: Host ALB and NAT gateways.
   - Private subnets: Host ECS tasks, RDS, ElastiCache, and OpenSearch.
   - Configure security groups to allow:
     - ALB: HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) from the internet.
     - Nginx: Port 80 from ALB.
     - PHP-FPM: Port 9000 from Nginx.
     - MySQL: Port 3306 from PHP-FPM containers.
     - Redis: Port 6379 from PHP-FPM containers.
     - Elasticsearch: Port 9200 from PHP-FPM containers.

2. **RDS (MySQL)**:

   - Launch an Amazon RDS MySQL instance in a private subnet.
   - Enable Multi-AZ for high availability.
   - Configure automated backups and encryption at rest (using AWS KMS).
   - Set up read replicas for read-heavy workloads.

3. **ElastiCache (Redis)**:

   - Deploy a Redis cluster with cluster mode disabled for simplicity.
   - Enable encryption in-transit and at-rest.
   - Place in a private subnet.

4. **OpenSearch (Elasticsearch)**:

   - Deploy an Amazon OpenSearch Service cluster in a private subnet.
   - Enable fine-grained access control and encryption.
   - Configure domain policies to allow access from PHP-FPM containers.

5. **ECS Cluster**:

   - Create an ECS cluster using Fargate for serverless container management.
   - Define task definitions for Nginx and PHP-FPM containers (see Docker Setup below).
   - Configure auto-scaling based on CPU/memory utilization.

6. **Application Load Balancer**:

   - Set up an ALB in public subnets to route traffic to Nginx containers.
   - Enable HTTPS with an ACM-managed SSL certificate.
   - Configure health checks for Nginx containers.

### 2. Docker Setup

1. **Dockerfile for Nginx**:

   - Use the official Nginx image.
   - Copy custom Nginx configuration for Laravel.
   - Expose port 80.

2. **Dockerfile for PHP-FPM**:

   - Use the official PHP-FPM image (e.g., `php:8.2-fpm`).
   - Install required PHP extensions (e.g., `pdo_mysql`, `redis`, `opensearch`).
   - Copy Laravel codebase and set permissions.

3. **Docker Compose (Local Development)**:

   - Define services for Nginx, PHP-FPM, Redis, MySQL, and Elasticsearch.
   - Use local volumes for development data.

4. **Example Docker Compose**:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
      - ./app:/var/www/html
    depends_on:
      - php-fpm
  php-fpm:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.php
    volumes:
      - ./app:/var/www/html
    depends_on:
      - mysql
      - redis
      - elasticsearch
  mysql:
    image: mysql:8.0
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: rootpassword
      MYSQL_DATABASE: laravel
    volumes:
      - mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql
  redis:
    image: redis:latest
  elasticsearch:
    image: opensearchproject/opensearch:latest
    environment:
      - discovery.type=single-node
volumes:
  mysql-data:
```

### 3. Laravel Configuration

1. Update `.env` file:

```env
APP_URL=https://your-domain.com
DB_HOST=rds-endpoint
DB_DATABASE=laravel
DB_USERNAME=admin
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
REDIS_HOST=elasticache-endpoint
REDIS_PORT=6379
OPENSEARCH_HOSTS=opensearch-endpoint
```

2. Configure Laravel for Redis (sessions/cache) and Elasticsearch (search).
3. Run `php artisan migrate` to set up the database.

### 4. CI/CD Pipeline

1. Create a GitHub Actions workflow:
   - Build Docker images for Nginx and PHP-FPM.
   - Push images to Amazon ECR.
   - Deploy to ECS using AWS CLI.
2. Example Workflow:

```yaml
name: Deploy to ECS
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Configure AWS Credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: us-east-1
      - name: Login to Amazon ECR
        uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v1
      - name: Build, tag, and push image to Amazon ECR
        env:
          ECR_REGISTRY: ${{ secrets.ECR_REGISTRY }}
          ECR_REPOSITORY: laravel-app
          IMAGE_TAG: latest
        run: |
          docker build -t $ECR_REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG .
          docker push $ECR_REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG
      - name: Deploy to ECS
        run: |
          aws ecs update-service --cluster laravel-cluster --service laravel-service --force-new-deployment
```

### 5. Security Best Practices

- **Network**: Restrict access using security groups and private subnets.
- **Encryption**: Enable HTTPS, encrypt data at rest (RDS, ElastiCache, OpenSearch), and use AWS KMS.
- **Secrets Management**: Store sensitive data (e.g., DB credentials) in AWS Secrets Manager.
- **IAM Roles**: Use least-privilege IAM roles for ECS tasks and CI/CD pipelines.
- **WAF**: Attach AWS WAF to ALB to protect against common web attacks.
- **Backups**: Enable automated backups for RDS and snapshot for OpenSearch.

### 6. Cost Optimization

- Use AWS Fargate Spot for non-critical tasks to reduce costs.
- Configure auto-scaling to scale down during low traffic.
- Use reserved instances for RDS and ElastiCache for predictable workloads.
- Monitor costs using AWS Cost Explorer.

### 7. Monitoring & Logging

- Enable CloudWatch Logs for ECS tasks, RDS, and OpenSearch.
- Set up CloudWatch Alarms for CPU, memory, and request latency.
- Use AWS X-Ray for tracing requests through the application.

## Deployment

1. Push code to GitHub to trigger the CI/CD pipeline.
2. Verify ECS service deployment via AWS Console.
3. Test the application via the ALB DNS or custom domain.

## Scaling

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Increase ECS task count based on load.
- **Database Scaling**: Add read replicas to RDS for read-heavy workloads.
- **Cache Scaling**: Add nodes to ElastiCache for Redis.
- **Search Scaling**: Scale OpenSearch nodes based on index size and query load.

## Troubleshooting

- Check CloudWatch Logs for errors.
- Verify security group rules and VPC connectivity.
- Ensure `.env` configurations match AWS service endpoints.
